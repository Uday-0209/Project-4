# IntelliPod
This is edge computing device, which is capable of capturing the vibration , temperature and tachometer readings.The data is processed  and analzed.

Contributions to the Project:
1) Development of the complete structure, including hardware selection, assembly, and integration.
2) LabVIEW program development for acquiring data from Advantech DAQs, which was further processed (e.g., FFT and STFT) and displayed.
3) Integration of the system with machine learning models for fault and defect detection.
4) The project had two versions. The first was a basic version that captured and displayed signals for monitoring purposes. The second version could capture and analyze vibration, temperature, tachometer data, and a few digital inputs and outputs.
5) This device operates in real time, and the technology was transferred to a private manufacturer.
